We cannot provide the dataset but you should download it from the FEVER website and use document retrieval codes like Athene's code to get the sentences and then make a TSV file.

You see here some samples and the format of the files you should create:
You would have two types of labels:
"evidence_label": a label showing the relation between a sentence and a claim.
"label": a label showing the ground-truth label for the claim. But you need to find the ground-truth sentences first, right!?
